Property is very dirty. Seems like they are not changing the bedsheets and covers after a guest. There were block of hairs on the bedsheet and cover sheets and on pillows. Bed is not comfortable at all. Had a back pain after sleeping for one night. There are smelly toilets in every floor for common use. No lift. Have to handover the room key every time we go out. We paid fully before coming to apartment, but they asked for a city tax after arrival.
